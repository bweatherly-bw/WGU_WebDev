Use a <caption> tag that describes the photo gallery's theme. The table should have 3 columns and 5 rows:

    The 1st row should use <th> tags to list the Photo, Date, and Description headings.
    
    The 2nd - 4th rows should display the given vacation images in the 1st column with an alt attribute and brief photo description, a date when the photo was taken in the 2nd column, and a lengthier photo description in the 3rd column.
    
    The 5th row should span all 3 columns and contain copyright information, including the copyright symbol.
